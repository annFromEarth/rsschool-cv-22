### About me

### Code Example
***VowelOne Kata from Codewars:*** write a function that takes a string and outputs a strings of 1's and 0's where vowels become 1's and non-vowels become 0's. All non-vowels including non alpha characters (spaces,commas etc.) should be included.

```
function vowelOne(s){
   let arr=s.split("").map(y=>y.toLowerCase()).map(x=>(x=="a"||x=="e"||x=="i"||x=="o"||x=="u")?"1":"0") ;
 return arr.join("")
    }
    
```
